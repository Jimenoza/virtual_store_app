## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a personal project I decided to make for learning React Native, a virtual store app, a project I made back in colleg which was only for web. This app
has its own backend (and web frontend) restructured in Laravel, which it uses for API consumption. The same requirements that were made in its web version are
present (at least for client users and not admin users):

* Search products
* Generate orders
* See products
* Filter by category
* See products by order
* Add/Remove products to/from cart
* Rate products
* Leave comments and replies from each product


### Built With

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

In a future I'll attach videos of the app running

In this section the requirements previously listed are shown with the app running locally on my android device and iOS simulator. The app running on iPhone could not
be recorded but I think the iOS simulator prooves it also runs on iOS
